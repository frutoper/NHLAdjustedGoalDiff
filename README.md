## NHL 2014-2015 Adjusted Goal Differential

Below are power ranking for the 2014-2015 NHL regular season.  The method I used was based on the Simple Ranking System outlined [HERE](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37) by Football Reference.  The ranking system is based on goal differential and the goal differential of your opponents.  The New York Ranger have the best goal differential (60), but lose 3 “Goals” due to their relatively weak schedule.  The St. Louis Blues have a goal differential of 47 and gain 1.6 “Goals” for their relatively tough schedule.  Recently fivethirtyeight.com used this system to [rate college basketball teams](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-years-kentucky-team-is-more-dominant-than-indianas-undefeated-1976-squad/).  Just like the NHL scoring system I included a goal for a shootout win. Let me know if you think these goals should be counted or not.
